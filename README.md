# Spotify-Clone

Created a Spotify Clone using MERN Stack 

Here I created 2 folders one for frontend and other for backend and connect backend to MongoDb, checked through postman, Used cookie to store token. For frontend I used ReactJs, cloudinary, used tailwindcss for styling and iconify for Icons.

command used: 

npm run start
npm i passport passport-jwt 
npm i dotenv  
npm i express  
npm i jwt           
npm i mongoose 
npm install mongodb  
npm install @craco/craco  
npx tailwindcss-cli@latest init  
npm i react-router-dom  
npm install postcss@8  
npx tailwindcss@2 -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/output.css        
npm install --save-dev @iconify/react
npm i cors  
npm i react-cookie 
npm i @cloudinary/react @cloudinary/url-gen cloudinary-core cloudinary-react   
npm i howler
